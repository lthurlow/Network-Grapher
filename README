Uploading old network graphing code.  Most of the code is incomplete to remove some of the data associated with it.  This code base is somewhat incomplete.

From what I recall there were multiple steps:

1. Scan which hosts are up using fping
2. Traceroute each host
3. Combine the traceroutes to get a single map
4. Run nessus, nmap, and Nexpose
5. Color nodes in graph based on security vulnerabilities from [4]
6. Convert to dot file, then graph
